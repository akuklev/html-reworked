<h1>CSS Reworked</h1>
The language of cascading style sheets has a number of well-known
deficiencies and inconsistencies. Fortunatelly, there is a way to
fix lots of them with minimal changes to syntax.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, CSS consists of at-rules (like <code>@import</code>, <code>@media</code>
and <code>@font-face</code>), and unprefixed rules. We'd gain more
consistency and natural syntax for scoped rules by requiring them
to start with <code>@rule</code>, just like this:
<pre>
<b><code>@rule</code></b> div.sidenote {
  font: smaller;
  color: rgba(0%, 0%, 0%, 0.9);
  <b><code>@rule</code></b> strong {
    font-weight: 300;
  }
}
</pre>
<br/>
It would be also nice to fix once and for all syntax for interpolation
of expressions (in host language, javascript by default). My favourite
is square brakets. If we assume, the “host language” is units-aware, we
can dispense with <code>calc(..)</code> and <code>attr(..)</code> in
favour of stuff like <code>[1em + 5px + additional-width]</code>.<br/>
<br/>
You probably know about how <code>&lt;li&gt;s</code> are styled:
<pre>
li:before {
  content: "•";
  padding-right: 8px;
}
</pre>

But you cannot really put HTML content there, and interpolation works
ugly. We propose the following syntax:
<b><code>@rule</code></b> li.before {
  &lt;([counter])&gt;
  padding-right: 8px;
}
</pre>

So, just put HTML template in the beginning of the body of the rule.
