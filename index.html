There is only one way to keep a rich text document truly accessible: its source
must be readable as plain text, the only aid allowed being pretty-printing.
HTML was designed to be like that, but it fails miserably since 20 years.
Markdown &amp; other lightweight markup languages do master it, but they fail at extenstensibility and
overuse cryptic ![](markup), where words do just as good.<br/>
<span class='slogan'>Let's refurbish HTML!</span>

<h1>Better HTML</h1>
Take HTML5, leave out bizarre syntax for CDATA, entities and comments, add
back notation for empty tags (as in <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>) from XML, and close-any tags (<code>&lt;/&gt;</code>)
from SGML, settle on syntax for [expression] interpolation and processing-directives (<code>@if</code>, <code>@each</code>, <code>@prettyprint</code>, etc.).
Introduce special syntax for special attribute types (IDs and classes), <a href='css-reworked'>unify other attributes with cascading styles</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Stop hindering line-breaking by treating breaks near to tags as whitespaces, work out pretty-printing representing tags more like compound brackets, less
like a part of the text, regain the symmetry between opening and closing tags.<br/>
<b style="line-height: 2.2em">There it is:</b>
<br/>  
<xtag type='Div' xid='example'><div class='cindented'>
  Text with a <xtag type='Span' xclass='emph'>of text</xtag>,<br/> an <xtag type='Image' xopts='src: ./smiley.png'></xtag>, and an<br/>
  optional <xtag type='Button' play xdirs='@if(ui-enabled)'></xtag>.</div>
</xtag><br/>
<br/>
Remarks on notation:<br/>
– class(es): as subscript(s) of tag separated by dot(s);<br/>
– id: right after tag type and class(es);<br/>
– styles: after tag type, class(es) and id, in braces;<br/>
– directives like <code>@if</code> and <code>@each</code>: in the end.<br/>

<br/>
Futhermore we want to have syntax for links, images and alike almost as tidy
as in markdown. So we'll allow to omit tag name in closing tag (universal closing tag, remember?)
and/or move style section to the closing tag if the user considers text
more readable this way, e.g. <br/><xtag type='Image' xopts='src: ./figure.png' short={true}>alt text</xtag>, <br/> 
and <xtag type='' xopts='ref: //www.example.org' short={true}>Link text</xtag>.<br/> In the latter case we make of the last additional feature:
anonymous tags, interpreted either as spans or a's (if only styles are present) or virtial tags (if only directives are present).<br/>
<br/>
Since reworked CSS we propose can contain new element definitions, it should be
considered a part of the DTD, so we propose the following type declaration for our HTML flavour:
<pre><code>&lt;!<b>DOCTYPE</b> html @<b>with</b> /path/to/stylesheet&gt;</code></pre>
or, for embedded css:
<pre><code>&lt;!<b>DOCTYPE</b> html @<b>with</b> [
  ... // stylesheet
]&gt;</code></pre>

At the same time, style tags and stylesheet links must be abolished.
For stylesheets spanning over multiple files, <code>@import</code>
rules can be used:
<pre><code>&lt;!<b>DOCTYPE</b> html @<b>with</b> [
  @import <a href='css-reworked'>./common.css</a> screen, projection;
  @import <a href='css-reworked'>./landscape.css</a> screen and (orientation:landscape);
]&gt;</code></pre>

<h2>Dream of a Rich Text Language</h2>
The language I'd like to use to write everything I write (from
blog entries to scientific articles and embedded documentation
in programs I write) using a mix of multimarkdown and this
variety of HTML. I really like how multimarkdown handles
linebreaks, lists, quotations, citations, code insertions and
alike, I really like being able to write _underscores_ for emphasized
text, but I also like to be able to freely intermix all of this with
proper HTML which is more readable and readily understandable by
unexpirienced persons in all other cases (including links, images,
footnotes, etc.). Thankfully, Multimarkdown has nothing which would hamper
intermixing with the variety of HTML we just described.<br/>
<br/>
Given a comprehensible library of components (such as date picker, spinner,
etc.) and the complete set of layout tags (<code>&lt;tabstop/&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;run-in/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;inline/&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;block/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;inline-block/&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;flex/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;inline-flex/&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;float/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;overlay/&gt;</code> and table stuff),
both enabled by <a href="css-reworked">CSS(reworked)</a>, it also
makes a perfect language for designing interactive visual UIs.<br/>
